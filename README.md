ðŸ§  NLP Lab
This is my NLP Lab â€” a place where I experiment, learn, and build in the world of natural language processing.

My interest in NLP really started after reading Attention Is All You Need.
Seeing how transformers completely reshaped the field â€” and how fast things were moving â€” made me want to dig deeper.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects:

Implementing and experimenting with core NLP models

Playing with embeddings, tokenization, and sequence modeling

Applying these models to practical problems and research questions

Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring something more specific:
how large language models deal with Theory of Mind (ToM) â€” in other words, whether they can reason about beliefs, knowledge, and intentions in a human-like way.

This repo brings together my experiments, course assignments, and research prototypes in one place.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
Foundations â€“ early NLP exercises and concepts

Model Implementations â€“ transformers, RNNs, and other architectures

Research Experiments â€“ probing ToM capabilities in LLMs

ðŸ›  Tech & Tools
Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn for analysis and visualization
